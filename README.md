# Spresense SDK build instructions

Build instructions are documented at [Spresense SDK Getting Started Guide](https://developer.sony.com/develop/spresense/docs/sdk_set_up_en.html).

## Prerequisites

Install the necessary packages and GCC ARM toolchain for cross-compilation.
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonydevworld/spresense/master/install-tools.sh
$ bash install-tools.sh
```

## Build

Go to the folder where you cloned the {SDK_FULL}, and enter the `sdk` folder name:
``` bash
$ cd spresense/sdk
```
Set up the SDK configuration
``` bash
$ tools/config.py examples/hello
```
Build the example image:
``` bash
$ make
```

A `nuttx.spk` file appears in the `sdk` folder when this step has successfully finished.
This file is the final result and can be flashed into the your board.

# Using docker

A pre-compiled docker container is available with all the pre-requisite that is needed in order to build the Spresense SDK.

In order to start using it simply type:

```
$ source spresense_env.sh
```

This script will create an alias `spresense` which should proceed the regular SDK build scripts and Make commands.

Examples:
```
SpresenseSDK: $ spresense tools/config.py examples/hello
SpresenseSDK: $ spresense make
```

# Network over usb

Check this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3jqhn9XQ4
In `sdk/configs/myconfig/deconf` already include all the changes required.

To use it:
```bash
$ tools/config.py myconfig
```

or if you need to modify details using menuconfig:
```bash
$ tools/config.py myconfig -m
```

And don't forget to save the changes back to myconfig:
```bash
$ make savedefconfig && cp defconfig configs/myconfig/
```

We could set the connectivity of the host machine in NetworkManager by setting `Shared to other computers` in the IPv4 tab.
